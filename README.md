# Cross-Platform Thread Pool Library in C with CMake and Google Test

This is a simple cross-platform thread pool library written in C. It provides a basic implementation of a thread pool using `pthread` for Unix-like systems and `Windows.h` for Windows. The library is designed for handling tasks using a worker thread pool, making it a great foundation for concurrent applications.

This library was generated by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) based on a user request for a C-based thread pool library that is cross-platform and follows lower-case function naming conventions. If you want to see the original discussion and code generation, you can find it [here](https://chat.openai.com/?id=YOUR_CONVERSATION_ID) (replace `YOUR_CONVERSATION_ID` with the actual link).

## Features

- Cross-platform support for POSIX (`pthread`) and Windows (`CreateThread`).
- Build as both **static** and **shared** libraries.
- Mutex and condition variable synchronization for thread safety.
- Support for dynamically adding tasks to the pool.
- Integrated CMake build system.
- Google Test for unit testing.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- **CMake** (version 3.10 or above)
- **GCC** or any C compiler that supports C99 standard.
- `pthread` library for Unix-like systems.
- `windows.h` for Windows systems.
- **Google Test** library for testing.

### Build Instructions

1. Create a separate build directory:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

2. Configure the project using CMake:
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

3. Build the project and run the tests:
    ```bash
    make
    ctest --verbose
    ```
